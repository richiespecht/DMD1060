#Week 2
        # Types of Variables
        
var_a = "richie"    # String / str

var_b = 4           # Integer / int

var_c = 5.6         # Float / float

    # Variables are case sensitive (var_b is not the same as var_B)
    # No special characters (besides _) in variable names
    # Always start variables with a lowercase letter
    # Underscore notation ---> first_name
    # Camel case notation ---> firstName

print (var_a)
print (var_b)
print (var_c)

    # You have the ability to reset variables later on in code
    
var_a = "richard"

print (var_a)

        #Arithmetic

a = 5 + 5           # The '5' is called an operand
a = (5 + 5) * 5     # Use ( ) to define order of operations

count = 0

while count != 5:
    print (count)
    count += 1      # is the same as writing 'count = count +1'
                    # put print line last if you want to print '5'
